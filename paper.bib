  abstract = "Despite global efforts to monitor, mitigate against, and prevent
              trash (mismanaged solid waste) pollution, no harmonized trash
              typology system has been widely adopted worldwide. This impedes
              the merging of datasets and comparative analyses. We addressed
              this problem by 1) assessing the state of trash typology and
              comparability, 2) developing a standardized and harmonized
              framework of relational tables and tools, and 3) informing
              practitioners about challenges and potential solutions. We
              analyzed 68 trash survey lists to assess similarities and
              differences in classification. We created comprehensive
              harmonized hierarchical tables and alias tables for item and
              material classes. On average, the 68 survey lists had 20.8\% of
              item classes in common and 29.9\% of material classes in common.
              Multiple correspondence analysis showed that the 68 surveys were
              not significantly different regarding organization type,
              ecosystem focus, or substrate focus. We built the Trash Taxonomy
              Tool (TTT) web-based application with query features and open
              access at openanalysis.org/trashtaxonomy. The TTT can be applied
              to improve, create, and compare trash surveys, and provides
              practitioners with tools to integrate datasets and maximize
              comparability. The use of TTT will ultimately facilitate
              improvements in assessing trends across space and time,
              identifying targets for mitigation, evaluating the effectiveness
              of prevention measures, informing policymaking, and holding
              producers responsible.",

              backend; Vue for frontend reactivity; NativeScript-Vue for mobile
              apps; Bulma for CSS; Leaflet for web-mapping; Turf.js for

              Stripe; ChartJS; AWS; and more. Anywhere from a single cigarette
              butt to the contents of an entire beach or street clean can be
              logged in a single geotagged photo. Alternatively, a simple index
              may be used if litter is incalculable. The open data includes an
              increasing 100+ pre-defined types of litter; 20+ corporate
              brands; verification status; coordinates; timestamp; phone model;

abstract = {Waste pollution is one of the most significant environmental issues in the modern world. The importance of recycling is well known, both for economic and ecological reasons, and the industry demands high efficiency. Current studies towards automatic waste detection are hardly comparable due to the lack of benchmarks and widely accepted standards regarding the used metrics and data. Those problems are addressed in this article by providing a critical analysis of over ten existing waste datasets and a brief but constructive review of the existing Deep Learning-based waste detection approaches. This article collects and summarizes previous studies and provides the results of authors’ experiments on the presented datasets, all intended to create a first replicable baseline for litter detection. Moreover, new benchmark datasets detect-waste and classify-waste are proposed that are merged collections from the above-mentioned open-source datasets with unified annotations covering all possible waste categories: bio, glass, metal and plastic, non-recyclable, other, paper, and unknown. Finally, a two-stage detector for litter localization and classification is presented. EfficientDet-D2 is used to localize litter, and EfficientNet-B2 to classify the detected waste into seven categories. The classifier is trained in a semi-supervised fashion making the use of unlabeled images. The proposed approach achieves up to 70% of average precision in waste detection and around 75% of classification accuracy on the test dataset. The code and annotations used in the studies are publicly available online11https://github.com/wimlds-trojmiasto/detect-waste..}
